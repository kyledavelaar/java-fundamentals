(like methods and constructors) initialization blocks are another place you can put code that performs operations

static initialization blocks (run when code first loaded)


instance initialization block (run when class instantiated)

class SmallInt {
  static int x;
  int y;

  static { x = 7 }; // static init block
  { y = 8 }; // instance init block
}


They run after the call to super()
