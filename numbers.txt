byte: 8 bits
short: 16
int: 32
long: 64
float: 32
double: 64


numbers can have underscores to make reading simpler (as long as they aren't at the beginning or end)
  int x = 1_000_000; // one million -> same as 1000000

for doubles/floats can't use _ directly next to the decimal point


if want to assign double to a float (see bit chart above) you must put an F at the end to tell the compiler you are ok with the loss of possible data precision
float f = 12.21232F;
