Enable assertions

Asserts can be use on private methods

Public Methods
  - They should not be used on public methods b/c they are open the outside world and assertions are not usually turned on in production envs.  Instead if you want to guarantee an argument to a method is appropriate for the method, throw an IllegalArgumentException
  - The only exception is for values that you know the public method should never ever be able to have


private void doStuff(int x) {
  assert (x > 0);
  assert (x < 1000): "x is " + x; // can add debugging text after the assertion
  // use x
}

Assertions should never modify state (cause side effects) but leave class same way it was before
