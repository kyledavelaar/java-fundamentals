Not Autoboxing
  Integer i1 = new Integer(100);

AutoBoxing (allowing the compiler under the hood to to do the above for us when we write this)
  Integer i1 = 100;


But be Careful!
  Integer i1 = 100;
  Integer i2 = 100;

  i1 != i2  // True b/c the are not the same object

  i1.equals(i2)  // true b/c their values are the same "meaningfully equivalent"

  i1 == i2 // True ---> so odd!  why? When autoboxing (not creating integers through Integer i1 = new Integer(100)) two instances will be equal if they have the same primitive value.  this is done to save memory.  This is done for Boolean, Byte, Character, Short, and Integer
