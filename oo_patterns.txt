GOALS
  - loose coupling
  - high cohesion
  - ease of creation
  - ease of maintenance
  - each of enhancement

COUPLING
  - degree to which one class knows about another class
  - class A should only know what class B has exposed through its interface
  - usually achieved through encapsulation

COHESION
  - how a single class is designed
  - classes should have a well focused purpose
  - focused classes make them reusable

OBJECT COMPOSITION
  - ClassA that HAS-a ClassB and IS-a ClassB

    public ClassA implements ClassB {
      private ClassB classB; // can now delegate to classB all of classB's logic

      classB.doStuff(); // and don't need to re-write doStuff() in ClassA as well
    }

  - This allows us code reuse
  - This allows us to have one subClass per functionality instead of having a class for every combination of functionalities, Mp3Video, MovVideo, etc.

SINGLETON
  - only one instance of a class
